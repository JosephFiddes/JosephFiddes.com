		<p>'Maze Mayhem - Rocket Rumble' is a video game based on the premise of controlling two separate games at once.</p>

		<p>I've also written a program that takes MIDI drumkit inputs and converts them to keypresses, allowing me to control my computer using an electric drumkit.</p>

		<p>I've also converted CT scans into a rough 3D model of my own brain.</p>
