		<p>The ondes Martenot is a musical instrument invented by Maurice Martenot in 1928. It is one of the very early electronic synthesizers, and its sound will be familiar to those who have heard the theramin. </p>
		<p>One of the most fascinating aspects of the ondes Martenot is its method of control. The &#x201C;ribbon&#x201D; is a piece of wire with a ring in the middle where the performer places their finger. By moving the ring to the left and right, the performer can change the pitch of the generated sound.</p>
		<p>There are probably only a few hundred or thousand ondes Martenots in the world right now, and I'd like to rectify that.</p>
